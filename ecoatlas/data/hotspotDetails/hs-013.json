    "summary": "St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a small island developing state in the Caribbean, faces increasingly severe hurricanes and tropical storms. Warmer ocean temperatures are fueling more intense and rapid-onset storms.",
    "climateImpact": "Climate change is increasing sea surface temperatures, which drives stronger hurricane formation. For small island nations, a single Category 4 or 5 storm can devastate the entire economy.",

      "Warmer ocean temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes",
      "Sea level rise amplifies storm surge damage",
      "Rapid intensification makes storms harder to prepare for",
      "Infrastructure damage exceeds GDP, crippling recovery",
      "Agricultural losses threaten food security"
    ],
    "scaleContext": "Hurricane Beryl in 2024 became the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. Storm damage costs in the Caribbean often exceed 200% of a nation's annual GDP.",
    "outlook": "Without global emissions reductions and increased climate finance for adaptation, small island states face repeated catastrophic losses and potential uninhabitability."
