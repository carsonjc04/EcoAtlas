    "summary": "The Arctic archipelago of Svalbard has experienced temperature increases of up to 5-7°C above the 1971-2000 average, making it one of the fastest-warming places on the planet.",
    "climateImpact": "Rapid Arctic warming drives permafrost thaw, sea ice loss, and glacier retreat, releasing stored carbon and methane while disrupting global weather patterns.",

      "Arctic amplification intensifies warming at 3-4x the global rate",
      "Sea ice loss exposes darker ocean, absorbing more heat",
      "Permafrost thaw releases methane and CO₂",
      "Glacier retreat raises sea levels and alters ocean salinity",
      "Disrupted polar vortex sends cold blasts to lower latitudes"
    ],
    "scaleContext": "Svalbard's annual mean temperature rose 3-5°C between 1971 and 2020. Winter temperatures have increased by up to 7°C. The Arctic has lost 40% of its summer sea ice since 1979.",
    "outlook": "Svalbard's warming trajectory could lead to ice-free Arctic summers by the 2040s, with irreversible consequences for global climate systems."
