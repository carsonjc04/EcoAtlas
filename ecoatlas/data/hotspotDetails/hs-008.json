    "summary": "Shanxi Province is China's largest coal-producing region and one of the world's most concentrated sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Sentinel-5P satellite data has identified persistent CO₂ and methane plumes over the region.",
    "climateImpact": "Coal mining and combustion from Shanxi release massive quantities of CO₂ and methane, making this single province a top global emissions contributor.",
    "causeEffect": [
      "Shanxi produces over 1 billion tons of coal annually",
      "Coal combustion releases CO₂ at industrial scale",
      "Coal seam methane venting adds a potent greenhouse gas",
      "Coal-fired power plants supply much of northern China's energy",
      "Local air pollution causes severe health impacts"
    ],
    "scaleContext": "Shanxi alone accounts for roughly 25% of China's coal production. China produces and consumes over half the world's coal. The province's emissions rival those of many entire countries.",
    "outlook": "China has pledged carbon neutrality by 2060, but coal production in Shanxi continues to expand in the short term to meet energy security demands."
