    "headline": "The Pantanal Is Burning: World's Largest Tropical Wetland in Crisis",
    "summary": "The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland spanning Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay, experienced record-breaking fires in 2020 and 2024 that burned over 25% of the ecosystem. Prolonged drought and rising temperatures are transforming this biodiversity hotspot.",
    "climateImpact": "Fires in the Pantanal release stored carbon from peat soils and vegetation, while drought reduces the wetland's capacity to function as a carbon sink and water regulator.",
    "causeEffect": [
      "Climate-driven drought reduces water levels in the wetland",
      "Dry conditions make vegetation highly flammable",
      "Agricultural fires escape into the wetland",
      "Peat and organic soil fires release stored carbon",
      "Biodiversity loss disrupts ecosystem services"
    ],
    "scaleContext": "The Pantanal spans 150,000 km² and is home to over 4,700 plant and animal species. In 2020, fires burned approximately 30% of the entire biome. 2024 fires were on track to exceed this.",
    "outlook": "Continued warming and deforestation in upstream watersheds could permanently alter the Pantanal's flood cycle, converting wetland to degraded savanna."
