    "summary": "Once one of Africa's largest lakes, Lake Chad has lost approximately 90% of its surface area due to climate change, overuse of water resources, and prolonged drought cycles in the Sahel region.",
    "climateImpact": "Rising temperatures increase evaporation and reduce rainfall in the Lake Chad Basin, accelerating the lake's decline and triggering cascading humanitarian crises.",

    "scaleContext": "Over 30 million people across four countries (Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon) depend on the Lake Chad Basin. The lake shrank from 25,000 km² in 1963 to under 2,500 km² today.",
    "outlook": "Without coordinated water management and climate adaptation, Lake Chad could functionally disappear, displacing millions and destabilizing the entire Sahel region."
