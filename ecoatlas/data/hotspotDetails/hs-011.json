    "headline": "The Sudd: One of the World's Largest Natural Methane Sources",
    "summary": "The Sudd is one of the largest tropical wetlands on Earth, spanning over 30,000 km² in South Sudan. As organic matter decomposes in its waterlogged soils, it releases significant quantities of methane — a natural but climate-relevant process.",
    "climateImpact": "Natural wetland methane emissions from the Sudd contribute to the global methane budget. As temperatures rise, warmer conditions could accelerate microbial decomposition and increase emissions further.",
    "causeEffect": [
      "Waterlogged conditions create anaerobic decomposition",
      "Microbial activity releases methane from organic matter",
      "Warming temperatures accelerate methane production",
      "Changing hydrology from upstream dams alters wetland extent",
      "Political instability limits research and monitoring"
    ],
    "scaleContext": "Global wetlands are the single largest natural source of methane, contributing approximately 150-220 Mt CH₄/year. The Sudd is estimated to contribute 3-7 Mt/year of this total.",
    "outlook": "Climate-driven changes in rainfall and temperature could either expand or contract the Sudd, with uncertain implications for future methane emissions."
